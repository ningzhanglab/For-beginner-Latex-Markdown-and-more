# Where and How to Use Markdown

A beginner-friendly setup guide for PhD students

Markdown is much easier to start than LaTeX because **you usually do not need a compiler or special installation**. A Markdown file is simply a plain-text file ending in `.md`.

If you can create a file called `notes.md`, type text into it, and open a preview, you can use Markdown.

## Quick choice: where should I write Markdown?

| Your situation | Recommended tool | Install anything? | Best for |
|---|---|---:|---|
| "I already use VS Code." | **VS Code** | VS Code only | Local notes, GitHub projects, research documentation |
| "I want nothing installed." | **GitHub web editor** | No | READMEs and repository documentation |
| "I want a Google-Docs-like collaborative Markdown editor." | **HackMD** | No | Shared notes, meetings, collaborative drafts |
| "I want a browser editor with a live preview." | **StackEdit** | No | Quick Markdown writing and previewing |
| "My notes live next to code and data analysis." | **Jupyter / Colab / Quarto** | Depends | Computational research notebooks and reproducible documents |

**Beginner recommendation:**

- If you already downloaded this repository, use **VS Code**.
- If you do not want to install anything, use the **GitHub web editor**, **HackMD**, or **StackEdit**.
- If you work with R/Python notebooks, use Markdown cells in **Jupyter/Colab**, or move to **Quarto** later.

> Markdown is portable. The same `.md` file can usually be opened in VS Code, GitHub, HackMD, StackEdit, Obsidian, and many other tools. However, advanced features can differ because the tools use different Markdown "flavors."

# 1. Using Markdown in VS Code

VS Code has built-in Markdown support. For basic Markdown writing and previewing, **you do not need a Markdown extension**.

Official documentation: <https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown>

## Step 1 - Install VS Code

Download VS Code from:

<https://code.visualstudio.com/>

If you already installed VS Code for LaTeX, you are ready.

## Step 2 - Create a Markdown file

In VS Code:

1. choose **File -> New Text File**;
2. save it as something ending in `.md`, for example:

```text
paper_notes.md
```

3. type:

```markdown
# Paper Notes

## Main question

What is the mechanism behind the result?

## Tasks

- [ ] Re-read Section 3
- [ ] Check the appendix
- [ ] Reproduce Figure 2
```

That is already a valid Markdown document.

## Step 3 - Open the Markdown preview

VS Code can show the rendered document instead of the raw `#`, `**`, and backticks.

### macOS

Open preview:

```text
Shift + Command + V
```

Open preview beside the source:

```text
Command + K, then V
```

### Windows / Linux

Open preview:

```text
Ctrl + Shift + V
```

Open preview beside the source:

```text
Ctrl + K, then V
```

The side-by-side view is particularly good for beginners:

```text
Markdown source             Rendered preview
-------------------         ----------------
# Results                   Results
                            -------
**Finding:** ...            Finding: ...
```

You can also open the Command Palette and search for:

```text
Markdown: Open Preview
Markdown: Open Preview to the Side
```

## Step 4 - Edit source and watch the preview

A simple workflow is:

1. keep the `.md` file on the left;
2. keep the preview on the right;
3. make one change;
4. save;
5. check the preview.

Unlike LaTeX, basic Markdown does **not** require a compile cycle.

## Step 5 - Add an image

Suppose your project looks like:

```text
project/
  notes.md
  figures/
    result.png
```

In `notes.md`, write:

```markdown
![Main result](figures/result.png)
```

Use **relative paths** like this when possible. They are much easier to move between VS Code and GitHub than paths such as `/Users/name/Desktop/...`.

## Step 6 - Add math when the renderer supports it

Many research-oriented Markdown tools support LaTeX-style math.

Inline:

```markdown
The parameter is $\beta$.
```

Display:

```markdown
$$
y_i = x_i'\beta + \varepsilon_i,
\qquad i=1,\ldots,n.
$$
```

Math support varies across Markdown tools, so always check the preview in the tool where the document will be read.

## Optional VS Code extensions

You do not need these to start. Add them only if you want the extra features.

- **markdownlint** - warns about inconsistent Markdown style.
- **Markdown All in One** - adds shortcuts and convenience features.

For a complete beginner, the built-in VS Code preview is enough.

# 2. Using Markdown directly on GitHub

GitHub renders Markdown in repository `README.md` files and throughout its web interface. GitHub uses **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)**, which includes features such as tables, task lists, and strikethrough.

Official guide: <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax>

## Edit a README without Git or VS Code

You can edit Markdown entirely in the browser.

1. Open a repository on GitHub.
2. Open `README.md` or another `.md` file.
3. Click the edit/pencil control.
4. Edit the Markdown source.
5. Use the preview option to inspect the rendered result.
6. Commit/save the change.

For a new repository, a simple README can begin with:

```markdown
# Replication Files

This repository contains the code and documentation for the project.

## Folder structure

- `data/` - input data
- `code/` - analysis code
- `output/` - generated tables and figures

## Reproduction

1. Run `01_clean.R`.
2. Run `02_analysis.R`.
3. Check `output/`.
```

## Good uses of GitHub Markdown

- repository `README.md` files;
- replication instructions;
- project documentation;
- issue descriptions;
- pull-request descriptions;
- public teaching materials.

## A privacy reminder

Do not put restricted data, confidential participant information, private API keys, or material prohibited by a data-use agreement into a public GitHub repository.

---

# 3. Using HackMD in the browser

HackMD is a browser-based Markdown workspace designed around writing, sharing, and real-time collaboration.

Website: <https://hackmd.io/>

It is useful when you want something closer to a collaborative shared document while still keeping the underlying content in Markdown.

## Beginner workflow

1. Open HackMD and create/sign in to an account.
2. Create a new note.
3. Type Markdown in the editor.
4. Use the rendered view/preview to check formatting.
5. Share the note with collaborators if needed.
6. Check sharing permissions before adding unpublished or sensitive material.

A coauthor-meeting note could look like:

```markdown
# Coauthor Meeting - 2026-09-26

## Decisions

- Keep the main sample definition.
- Move robustness results to the appendix.

## Questions

- Why does the estimate change in the rural subsample?

## Next actions

- [ ] Update Table 2
- [ ] Re-run robustness checks
- [ ] Draft response to referee comment 4
```

HackMD is especially convenient for:

- meeting notes;
- shared research notes;
- reading groups;
- collaborative outlines;
- lightweight documentation.

# 4. Using StackEdit in the browser

StackEdit is an in-browser Markdown editor with a live preview.

Website: <https://stackedit.io/>

Its official site describes support for Markdown flavors including GitHub Flavored Markdown and CommonMark, live preview, LaTeX-style mathematical expressions, and synchronization options with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and GitHub.

## Beginner workflow

1. Open StackEdit.
2. Start a new document.
3. Type Markdown in the source/editor pane.
4. Watch the rendered preview.
5. Export or synchronize the document if needed.

StackEdit is useful when you want to practice Markdown in a browser without setting up a local project.

Example:

```markdown
# Seminar Notes

**Speaker:** Jane Doe  
**Topic:** Labor market adjustment

## Main contribution

The paper studies ...

## Equation I want to revisit

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \varepsilon_i.
$$

## Questions

1. How is the sample selected?
2. What is the identifying variation?
```

---

# 5. Markdown in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

If you analyze data in Python, Julia, or R notebooks, you can combine **code cells** with **Markdown cells**.

A Markdown cell can contain:

```markdown
## Results

The coefficient is positive in the baseline sample.

$$
\hat{\beta} = 0.12.
$$

The next cell reproduces the figure.
```

Then the next notebook cell can contain the actual Python/R code.

This is useful for:

- exploratory analysis;
- computational notes;
- teaching notebooks;
- documenting why a code block exists;
- keeping equations and interpretation next to results.

A notebook is not the same as a plain `.md` file, but Markdown syntax is used inside its text cells.

---

# 6. Markdown with Quarto

Quarto is useful when you eventually want Markdown-like source plus:

- citations;
- cross-references;
- equations;
- executable R/Python/Julia code;
- HTML, PDF, or Word output.

A Quarto source file usually ends in `.qmd` rather than `.md`.

Example:

```markdown
---
title: "Research Note"
format: html
---

# Results

The analysis is summarized below.
```

You can edit Quarto in VS Code or RStudio. It is a good next step after ordinary Markdown, but you do not need it to learn Markdown.

---

# 7. Which tool should a non-technical PhD student choose?

## Use VS Code if ...

- you already use it for LaTeX;
- you want your notes stored as local files;
- you want one folder containing code, Markdown, figures, and LaTeX;
- you plan to use GitHub later.

## Use GitHub's web editor if ...

- you mainly need to edit a README;
- you want to contribute a small documentation change;
- you do not want to install an editor.

## Use HackMD if ...

- several people need to edit a note together;
- you want browser-based collaboration;
- you want a shared seminar/coauthor document.

## Use StackEdit if ...

- you want a browser editor with a live preview;
- you are practicing Markdown;
- you want to work without configuring VS Code.

## Use Jupyter / Colab if ...

- prose belongs directly beside executable code;
- the document is part of data analysis rather than a standalone note.

## Use Quarto if ...

- you want reproducible academic documents from Markdown-like source;
- you need citations, cross-references, code execution, and multiple output formats.

# 8. Important: Markdown looks slightly different across tools

Do not assume every feature works everywhere.

The following are broadly portable:

```markdown
# Heading

**bold**

*italic*

- bullet

1. numbered item

[link](https://example.com)

`inline code`
```

These may vary by renderer:

- mathematical expressions;
- footnotes;
- task lists;
- callouts/admonitions;
- citations;
- automatic cross-references;
- diagrams;
- YAML metadata.

**Rule:** write using the common Markdown core when portability matters, and use advanced features only when you know which renderer will display the file.

---

# 9. Moving the same file between VS Code, GitHub, and web editors

Because Markdown is plain text, the basic workflow is simple:

```text
notes.md
   |
   +--> edit locally in VS Code
   +--> upload/commit to GitHub
   +--> open/copy into HackMD
   +--> open/copy into StackEdit
```

For maximum portability:

1. keep images in the project folder;
2. use relative image links;
3. avoid tool-specific syntax unless necessary;
4. keep filenames simple;
5. save the source as UTF-8;
6. preview the file on the platform where readers will view it.

---

# 10. Exporting Markdown to PDF

Markdown itself is only source text. PDF export depends on the tool.

## Simplest option

If your editor provides a print/export view, use it for a quick PDF.

## Reproducible academic option: Pandoc

If Pandoc and a LaTeX distribution such as TinyTeX are installed:

```bash
pandoc notes.md -o notes.pdf
```

This is useful when you want the same Markdown source to generate a repeatable PDF.

## Quarto

For a Quarto file:

```bash
quarto render notes.qmd --to pdf
```

For beginners, PDF export is optional. Learn ordinary Markdown writing and previewing first.

---

# 11. Five-minute practice exercise

Create a file named:

```text
my_first_markdown_note.md
```

Paste:

```markdown
# My First Research Note

## Question

What am I trying to understand?

## Notes

**Main idea:** Write one sentence here.

- Evidence 1
- Evidence 2
- Evidence 3

## Tasks

- [x] Create this file
- [ ] Add one paper citation/link
- [ ] Add one equation
- [ ] Add one image

## Code or command

Run `python analysis.py` after cleaning the data.

## Equation

$$
y_i = x_i'\beta + \varepsilon_i,
\qquad i=1,\ldots,n.
$$
```

Then open the preview in VS Code or paste the same source into a browser Markdown editor.

You now know enough Markdown to create useful research notes.
