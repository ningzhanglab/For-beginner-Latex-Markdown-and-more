# Before You Start: What Markdown Is

Markdown is a **plain-text writing format**. You type ordinary text plus a small amount of punctuation, and a Markdown renderer turns it into formatted output such as HTML, a preview pane, or a PDF.

For an Econ PhD student, Markdown is especially useful for:

- research notes and daily logs;
- reading notes for papers;
- project `README.md` files;
- replication instructions;
- seminar and class notes;
- data dictionaries;
- code documentation;
- GitHub repositories;
- Jupyter / VS Code / Obsidian notes;
- Quarto or Pandoc documents that combine prose, math, citations, and code.

Markdown is **not a replacement for LaTeX in every situation**. For a journal-style paper with complicated tables, theorem environments, or strict submission formatting, LaTeX is often better. Markdown is usually faster for notes, documentation, drafts, and reproducible workflows.

> **Beginner mental model:** Markdown is normal text first. Formatting is added with a few visible punctuation marks.

---

# 1. Markdown Is Not One Single Standard

This is the most important fact beginners often miss.

There is a common core, but different systems add features.

| Flavor / tool | Typical use | Important extras |
|---|---|---|
| CommonMark | general Markdown standard | basic syntax |
| GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) | GitHub READMEs/issues | tables, task lists, strikethrough |
| Pandoc Markdown | academic conversion | citations, footnotes, math, metadata |
| Quarto | research documents | citations, cross-references, executable code |
| Jupyter Markdown | notebooks | math, code-adjacent documentation |
| Obsidian | personal knowledge base | wiki links, callouts, embeds |

A feature that works in Quarto may not work in a simple GitHub preview.

**Rule:** when something behaves strangely, first ask **which Markdown renderer am I using?**

---

# 2. Your First Markdown File

A Markdown file usually ends in `.md`.

Example filename:

```text
research_notes.md
```

A minimal file can be only:

```markdown
# Research Notes

Today I cleaned the county-level employment data.

## Next step

Estimate the baseline specification.
```

Rendered:

# Research Notes

Today I cleaned the county-level employment data.

## Next step

Estimate the baseline specification.

You do **not** need a document class, package declarations, or `\begin{document}` as you do in LaTeX.

---

# 3. Headings

Use `#` characters at the beginning of a line.

## Source

```markdown
# Level 1 heading
## Level 2 heading
### Level 3 heading
#### Level 4 heading
```

## Rendered idea

# Level 1 heading
## Level 2 heading
### Level 3 heading
#### Level 4 heading

For research notes, a practical hierarchy is:

```markdown
# Project title
## Data
### Raw data
### Cleaning
## Empirical strategy
## Results
## Questions
```

### Common mistake: no space after `#`

Prefer:

```markdown
## Results
```

not:

```text
##Results
```

---

# 4. Paragraphs and Line Breaks

Markdown uses **blank lines** to separate paragraphs.

## Source

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
```

## Rendered

This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.

A normal single line break in the source often **does not** create a new paragraph.

```markdown
Line one.
Line two.
```

may render as one paragraph depending on the renderer.

If you truly need a hard line break, common options are:

```markdown
Line one.  
Line two.
```

(two spaces at the end of the first line), or in HTML-capable Markdown:

```html
Line one.<br>
Line two.
```

**For academic prose:** usually use blank lines for paragraphs instead of forcing line breaks.

---

# 5. Bold, Italic, and Strikethrough

## Source

```markdown
**bold text**
*italic text*
***bold and italic***
~~deleted or obsolete text~~
```

## Rendered

**bold text**  
*italic text*  
***bold and italic***  
~~deleted or obsolete text~~

Useful research-note pattern:

```markdown
**Finding:** The coefficient is stable across specifications.

**Question:** Why does the estimate fall after adding region fixed effects?

**TODO:** Check whether the 2012 observations are duplicated.
```

Rendered:

**Finding:** The coefficient is stable across specifications.

**Question:** Why does the estimate fall after adding region fixed effects?

**TODO:** Check whether the 2012 observations are duplicated.

---

# 6. Markdown Characters You May Need to Escape

Markdown punctuation has meaning. To show it literally, prepend a backslash.

| Want to display | Often type |
|---|---|
| `*` | `\*` |
| `_` | `\_` |
| `#` | `\#` |
| `[` | `\[` |
| `]` | `\]` |
| `` ` `` | `` \` `` |
| `>` | `\>` |
| `-` | `\-` when needed |
| `\` | `\\` in some contexts |

Example:

```markdown
The variable is named `income_after_tax`.
```

For filenames, variable names, commands, and literal punctuation, **inline code** is usually cleaner than escaping everything.

---

# 7. Inline Code: One of the Most Useful Markdown Features

Use single backticks to show code or literal text.

## Source

```markdown
Run `reg y x, robust` after cleaning the sample.
The main file is `analysis.R`.
The variable is `county_id`.
```

## Rendered

Run `reg y x, robust` after cleaning the sample.  
The main file is `analysis.R`.  
The variable is `county_id`.

This is the Markdown equivalent of the “show the command literally” idea you used in the LaTeX guide.

It is excellent for:

- filenames;
- variable names;
- shell commands;
- R / Python / Stata commands;
- LaTeX commands such as `\qquad`;
- package names;
- directory names.

---

# 8. Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for a block of code.

## Source

````markdown
```r
model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
summary(model)
```
````

## Rendered

```r
model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
summary(model)
```

The word after the opening backticks is the **language identifier**. Many renderers use it for syntax highlighting.

Common examples for Econ PhD work:

````markdown
```python
import pandas as pd
```

```r
library(fixest)
```

```stata
reg y x1 x2, robust
```

```bash
pandoc notes.md -o notes.pdf
```

```latex
\begin{align}
y_i &= x_i'\beta + \varepsilon_i.
\end{align}
```
````

### Code block without a language

````markdown
```
plain text
or pseudocode
```
````

### Common mistake: forgetting to close the fence

Every opening triple backtick needs a closing triple backtick.

---

# 9. Lists

## Unordered lists

```markdown
- Download raw data
- Clean identifiers
- Merge county controls
- Estimate baseline model
```

Rendered:

- Download raw data
- Clean identifiers
- Merge county controls
- Estimate baseline model

You can also use `*`, but using `-` consistently is simple.

## Ordered lists

```markdown
1. Load the data.
2. Restrict the sample.
3. Estimate the model.
4. Export the table.
```

Rendered:

1. Load the data.
2. Restrict the sample.
3. Estimate the model.
4. Export the table.

### Useful trick: you can type `1.` repeatedly

```markdown
1. First step
1. Second step
1. Third step
```

Many Markdown renderers automatically display 1, 2, 3.

This makes reordering items easier.

---

# 10. Nested Lists

Indent sub-items.

```markdown
- Main analysis
  - Baseline sample
  - Alternative sample
- Robustness
  - Different controls
  - Different clustering
```

Rendered:

- Main analysis
  - Baseline sample
  - Alternative sample
- Robustness
  - Different controls
  - Different clustering

For readability, use consistent indentation, commonly two or four spaces depending on your editor/renderer.

---

# 11. Task Lists / Checkboxes

Very useful for research workflows.

```markdown
- [x] Download CPS data
- [x] Construct treatment variable
- [ ] Check missing values
- [ ] Reproduce Figure 2
- [ ] Draft data appendix
```

Rendered in supporting systems such as GitHub:

- [x] Download CPS data
- [x] Construct treatment variable
- [ ] Check missing values
- [ ] Reproduce Figure 2
- [ ] Draft data appendix

This is typically associated with **GitHub Flavored Markdown**.

---

# 12. Links

## Named link

```markdown
[American Economic Review](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/aer)
```

Rendered:

[American Economic Review](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/aer)

## Automatic URL

```markdown
<https://www.aeaweb.org/>
```

Rendered:

<https://www.aeaweb.org/>

## Useful academic pattern

```markdown
- Paper: [Title](https://example.com/paper.pdf)
- Data: [Replication files](https://example.com/data)
- Code: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/example/repo)
```

---

# 13. Images

Basic syntax:

```markdown
![Alternative text](figures/main_result.png)
```

The syntax is almost the same as a link, but starts with `!`.

- `Alternative text` describes the image.
- `figures/main_result.png` is the image path.

Recommended project structure:

```text
project/
|-- README.md
|-- notes/
|-- code/
|-- data/
`-- figures/
    `-- main_result.png
```

Then your README can use:

```markdown
![Main result](figures/main_result.png)
```

### Common mistake: wrong relative path

If the Markdown file is in `notes/` but the figure is in the project-level `figures/` folder, you may need:

```markdown
![Main result](../figures/main_result.png)
```

---

# 14. Blockquotes

Use `>`.

## Source

```markdown
> The identifying assumption is most credible when treatment timing is unrelated to short-run local shocks.
```

## Rendered

> The identifying assumption is most credible when treatment timing is unrelated to short-run local shocks.

Useful for:

- quotations from a paper;
- advisor comments;
- your own “important warning” notes;
- excerpts you want visually separated from your summary.

Nested blockquote:

```markdown
> Main quote
>
>> Your reaction to the quote
```

---

# 15. Horizontal Rules

Use three or more hyphens:

```markdown
---
```

Rendered:

---

Useful for separating sections in notes or READMEs, but do not overuse them if headings already provide structure.

---

# 16. Tables

Markdown tables are ideal for **small, simple tables**.

## Source

```markdown
| Variable | Mean | SD |
|---|---:|---:|
| Income | 52.4 | 13.2 |
| Employment | 0.81 | 0.39 |
| Age | 41.7 | 11.8 |
```

## Rendered

| Variable | Mean | SD |
|---|---:|---:|
| Income | 52.4 | 13.2 |
| Employment | 0.81 | 0.39 |
| Age | 41.7 | 11.8 |

Alignment syntax:

```text
:---   left aligned
:---:  centered
---:   right aligned
```

### Good use cases

- variable dictionaries;
- small summary tables;
- project status tables;
- literature comparison tables;
- file descriptions.

### Poor use cases

Markdown tables are not ideal for a complicated journal regression table with panels, multicolumn headings, notes, and precise spacing. Use LaTeX, HTML, or generated tables for those.

---

# 17. Pipe Characters Inside Tables

A `|` separates table columns. If you need a literal pipe, escape it when the renderer supports this:

```markdown
A \| B
```

or put the content in inline code when appropriate.

This is a common reason Markdown tables suddenly gain an extra column.

---

# 18. Math in Markdown

Math support is **renderer-dependent**. Pandoc, Quarto, Jupyter, and many note systems support LaTeX-style math through MathJax/KaTeX or a TeX engine.

## Inline math

```markdown
The sample mean is $\bar{x} = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$.
```

Rendered here:

The sample mean is $\bar{x} = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$.

## Display math

```markdown
$$
y_i = x_i'\beta + \varepsilon_i.
$$
```

Rendered:

$$
y_i = x_i'\beta + \varepsilon_i.
$$

### Useful fact for your LaTeX knowledge

Inside a math-capable Markdown renderer, familiar LaTeX math commands often work:

```markdown
$$
y_i = x_i'\beta + \varepsilon_i,
\qquad i=1,\ldots,n.
$$
```

So commands such as `\quad`, `\qquad`, `\frac`, `\sum`, `\mathbb`, and `\text` may be usable **inside math**, even though Markdown itself is not LaTeX.

---

# 19. Math: What Is Markdown and What Is LaTeX?

This distinction matters.

```markdown
**bold**
```

is Markdown syntax.

But:

```latex
\qquad
\frac{a}{b}
\sum_{i=1}^n
```

are LaTeX math commands interpreted by a math renderer.

Think of it as:

> Markdown handles document structure and simple formatting; a math engine handles the formula inside `$...$` or `$$...$$`.

---

# 20. Footnotes

Footnote syntax is not part of the smallest Markdown core, but Pandoc, GitHub, and many academic tools support it.

## Source

```markdown
The sample excludes observations with missing wages.[^1]

[^1]: Results are similar when these observations are retained and missing wages are coded separately.
```

## Rendered idea

The sample excludes observations with missing wages.[^1]

[^1]: Results are similar when these observations are retained and missing wages are coded separately.

You can keep the footnote definition later in the file instead of interrupting the paragraph.

---

# 21. Comments That Do Not Render

HTML comments are widely useful:

```html
<!-- TODO: verify sample size before sending to advisor. -->
```

The comment remains in the source but normally does not appear in rendered output.

Excellent for private drafting notes:

```markdown
<!-- Ask Alex whether we should cluster at the county or state level. -->
```

---

# 22. YAML Front Matter

Pandoc, Quarto, R Markdown, and other systems can read metadata at the very top of a file.

```yaml
---
title: "Labor Market Project Notes"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2026-09-26"
---
```

This is called **YAML front matter**.

In a Quarto/Pandoc workflow you may add options such as:

```yaml
---
title: "Research Notes"
author: "Your Name"
format: pdf
toc: true
number-sections: true
---
```

**Important:** exact option names differ across tools. Do not assume every YAML option works in every Markdown renderer.

---

# 23. Academic Citations: Plain Markdown Does Not Standardize Them

Plain Markdown does not define a universal academic citation system.

Pandoc / Quarto commonly support citation keys such as:

```markdown
Acemoglu and Autor emphasize task-based changes in labor demand [@example2020].

Related work reaches similar conclusions [@example2020; @other2022].
```

A bibliography file might be specified in YAML:

```yaml
---
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

A BibTeX entry could look like:

```bibtex
@article{example2020,
  author  = {Author, Alice and Author, Bob},
  title   = {Example Paper},
  journal = {Example Journal},
  year    = {2020},
  volume  = {10},
  pages   = {1--25}
}
```

This is **Pandoc/Quarto citation syntax**, not universal Markdown.

---

# 24. Cross-References: Also Tool-Dependent

Basic Markdown has links but no universal system for “Figure 2” or “Equation 3” references.

Quarto adds powerful cross-reference syntax. For example, a figure may have a label such as `fig-main`, and the prose can refer to `@fig-main`.

Because syntax varies by tool, treat cross-referencing as a feature of **Quarto/Pandoc extensions**, not core Markdown.

For simple notes, ordinary headings and links are often enough.

---

# 25. Linking to a Heading in the Same File

Many renderers automatically generate anchors for headings.

For a heading:

```markdown
## Data Construction
```

you may be able to link with:

```markdown
[Jump to tables](#tables)
```

Rendered:

[Jump to tables](#tables)

Anchor-generation rules can vary, especially for punctuation and duplicate headings.

---

# 26. Reference-Style Links

Useful when the same URL appears repeatedly or you want cleaner prose.

```markdown
Read the [AER article][aer-paper] and the [replication files][replication].

[aer-paper]: https://example.com/paper
[replication]: https://example.com/data
```

This keeps long URLs away from the paragraph.

---

# 27. Email Addresses and URLs

You can often use:

```markdown
<name@example.edu>
```

or:

```markdown
<https://example.edu/project>
```

For a named link, prefer:

```markdown
[Project page](https://example.edu/project)
```

---

# 28. File Paths and Commands

Use inline code:

```markdown
Open `data/raw/cps_2025.csv`.
Run `code/01_clean.R` before `code/02_estimate.R`.
```

This is cleaner than italics or quotation marks because it immediately signals a literal filename/path.

---

# 29. A Good Econ Project README Structure

A useful `README.md` might look like this:

````markdown
# Project Title

One-sentence description of the project.

## Repository structure

```text
project/
|-- code/
|-- data/
|-- figures/
|-- output/
`-- README.md
```

## Data

- `data/raw/`: original files; never edited manually
- `data/clean/`: analysis-ready data

## Replication order

1. Run `code/01_clean.R`.
2. Run `code/02_analysis.R`.
3. Run `code/03_figures.R`.

## Main outputs

- `output/table1.tex`
- `figures/figure1.pdf`

## Software

- R 4.x
- Stata 19

## Notes

Large confidential data are not included in the repository.
````

This is one of the highest-value uses of Markdown in research.

---

# 30. Paper Reading Note Template

````markdown
# Paper Title

**Authors:**  
**Journal / year:**  
**Link:**  
**Date read:**

## One-sentence contribution

What is the paper's main contribution?

## Research question

What exactly is being asked?

## Data

- Unit of observation:
- Sample period:
- Main outcome:
- Main explanatory variable:

## Empirical / theoretical approach

Explain the approach in your own words.

## Main result

What should you remember six months from now?

## Identification / key assumptions

1. 
2. 

## What I learned

- 
- 

## Questions / weaknesses

- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## Useful citation / quote

> Short quotation or paraphrase location.

## Connection to my work

Why does this paper matter for my project?
````

---

# 31. Research Log Template

A daily research log is extremely useful during a PhD.

````markdown
# Research Log - 2026-09-26

## Goal for today

Reproduce the baseline summary statistics.

## What I did

- Cleaned county identifiers.
- Removed duplicate observations.
- Re-ran `01_clean.R`.

## Result

The final sample contains **18,427 observations**.

## Problem encountered

Merge rate fell from 98% to 91% after adding 2011 data.

## Hypothesis

County FIPS codes may have lost leading zeros.

## Next actions

- [ ] Inspect unmatched FIPS codes.
- [ ] Compare raw and cleaned identifiers.
- [ ] Re-run Table 1.

## Files changed

- `code/01_clean.R`
- `notes/data_issues.md`
````

This kind of documentation is often more valuable than trying to remember what you did two weeks later.

---

# 32. Seminar / Class Notes Template

````markdown
# Seminar: Speaker - Paper Title

**Date:**  
**Speaker:**  
**Institution:**

## Research question

## Why it matters

## Model / empirical design

## Data

## Main result

## Questions from the audience

1. 
2. 

## My questions

- 
- 

## Ideas relevant to my research

- 
````

---

# 33. Data Dictionary in Markdown

Markdown tables work well for a lightweight data dictionary.

```markdown
| Variable | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `county_fips` | string | 5-digit county FIPS | Census |
| `employment` | numeric | employment rate | CPS |
| `treatment` | binary | treatment indicator | constructed |
```

Rendered:

| Variable | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `county_fips` | string | 5-digit county FIPS | Census |
| `employment` | numeric | employment rate | CPS |
| `treatment` | binary | treatment indicator | constructed |

---

# 34. Literature Matrix in Markdown

For a small literature set:

```markdown
| Paper | Question | Data | Method | Main takeaway |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Author A (2024) | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Author B (2025) | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

For dozens or hundreds of papers, a spreadsheet or reference manager is usually better.

---

# 35. Details / Collapsible Sections (HTML Extension)

On renderers that permit HTML:

```html
<details>
<summary>Show robustness notes</summary>

Additional details go here.

</details>
```

This is useful in GitHub READMEs, but it is **not universal Markdown** and may behave differently in PDF conversion.

---

# 36. HTML Inside Markdown

Many Markdown engines allow some raw HTML:

```html
<br>
<sup>1</sup>
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>
```

Use HTML only when Markdown syntax is insufficient. Heavy HTML reduces portability.

---

# 37. Common Mistake: Using Markdown Like Microsoft Word

Markdown is designed around **structure**, not manual visual placement.

Avoid trying to create layouts with dozens of spaces:

```text
Name: John                              Date: 2026
```

Use a table, a proper renderer feature, or another format if alignment is important.

Likewise, do not use repeated blank lines to push text down a page.

---

# 38. Common Mistake: Too Many Heading Levels

A research note rarely needs:

```text
###### Level 6 heading
```

Prefer a shallow hierarchy:

```text
# Project
## Main section
### Subsection
```

If you need six levels, the note may need restructuring.

---

# 39. Common Mistake: Forgetting Blank Lines Around Blocks

Some renderers are forgiving; others are not.

Safer:

```markdown
Paragraph text.

- item one
- item two

Next paragraph.
```

instead of tightly attaching every block.

---

# 40. Common Mistake: Broken Code Fences

Wrong:

````text
```r
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)

Next paragraph begins here...
````

The closing fence is missing, so the rest of the document may become code.

Correct:

````markdown
```r
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)
```

Next paragraph begins here.
````

---

# 41. Common Mistake: Backticks Inside Inline Code

If your literal text itself contains a backtick, use more backticks as the outer delimiter.

Example source:

```markdown
``Use `code` inside this literal text.``
```

The exact behavior depends on the Markdown parser, but the general principle is: **use a longer backtick delimiter than the backticks inside the content**.

---

# 42. Common Mistake: Overusing Bold

If every sentence is bold, nothing is emphasized.

Better:

```markdown
**Main finding:** Employment rises by roughly 3 percent.

The result is stable across the preferred specifications.
```

Use bold as a signal, not as the default typography.

---

# 43. Common Mistake: Confusing a Hyphen with a List

A hyphen at the start of a line followed by a space creates a list item:

```markdown
- item
```

If you mean literal text, put it in inline code or escape it if needed.

---

# 44. Common Mistake: Markdown Tables for Complex Regression Output

A table such as:

```text
Panel A
Columns (1)-(8)
multicolumn groupings
standard errors beneath coefficients
multiple notes
```

will become painful in plain Markdown.

Better choices:

- LaTeX table;
- HTML table;
- generated output from R/Stata/Python;
- Quarto table tools.

Markdown is best for **small human-readable tables**, not precision journal typesetting.

---

# 45. Common Mistake: Assuming Math Works Everywhere

This:

```markdown
$E[Y_i \mid X_i]$
```

works in many academic renderers, but not in every basic Markdown preview.

If math matters, use a known math-capable environment such as:

- Quarto;
- Jupyter;
- Pandoc with math support;
- Obsidian;
- VS Code extensions that support math.

---

# 46. Common Mistake: Assuming Citation Syntax Works Everywhere

This:

```markdown
[@smith2025]
```

is excellent in Pandoc/Quarto, but GitHub will usually display it literally.

Again: know the renderer.

---

# 47. Common Mistake: Spaces in File Names

This is legal on modern systems but often annoying in code and reproducible workflows.

Prefer:

```text
main_results.md
paper_notes_2026-09-26.md
figure_01.png
```

instead of:

```text
Main Results Final New.md
```

For reproducible research, consistent filenames matter more than fancy filenames.

---

# 48. Common Mistake: “final_final_v3_revised.md”

Version numbers in filenames become chaotic.

Better:

- Git for version history;
- clear stable filenames;
- dated research logs when chronology matters.

Example:

```text
README.md
analysis_plan.md
2026-09-26_research_log.md
```

---

# 49. GitHub README Habits for Research Repositories

A useful research repository README should answer:

1. What is this project?
2. What data are required?
3. Where are files located?
4. In what order should scripts run?
5. What software/packages are needed?
6. What files are generated?
7. Are any data restricted?
8. Who should be contacted with questions?

Markdown is nearly ideal for this job.

---

# 50. Useful README Badges: Optional, Not Necessary

GitHub projects sometimes include badges for build status, DOI, license, etc.

These are useful for public software/data projects but usually unnecessary for a private dissertation repository.

Do not confuse professional documentation with decorative badges.

---

# 51. Markdown + Git

Markdown works beautifully with Git because `.md` files are plain text.

Git can show exactly which lines changed.

Typical workflow:

```bash
git status
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update replication instructions"
git push
```

This is a major advantage over binary formats such as `.docx` for technical project documentation.

---

# 52. Markdown + VS Code

Typical VS Code workflow:

1. Create `notes.md`.
2. Write Markdown in the editor.
3. Open Markdown Preview.
4. Edit source and watch the preview update.

Useful built-in concept:

```text
source pane | rendered preview
```

This is one of the easiest ways for a beginner to learn Markdown because every change is immediately visible.

---

# 53. Markdown + Obsidian

Obsidian uses Markdown files for a personal knowledge base.

Useful PhD applications:

- one note per paper;
- one note per research idea;
- seminar notes;
- advisor-meeting notes;
- linking related concepts.

Obsidian adds features such as `[[wiki links]]` that are **not universal Markdown**.

---

# 54. Markdown + Jupyter

Jupyter notebooks alternate between:

- **Markdown cells** for explanation; and
- **code cells** for execution.

A good empirical notebook should not be 100 lines of unexplained code. Use Markdown cells to explain:

- what the next code block does;
- why the transformation is necessary;
- what the result means;
- what remains unresolved.

This makes notebooks much easier to revisit months later.

# 55. Markdown + Quarto

Quarto is particularly relevant for economics because it combines Markdown-style writing with executable code, citations, equations, cross-references, and multiple outputs.

Conceptually:

```text
Markdown prose
+ equations
+ R/Python/Julia code
+ bibliography
+ figures/tables
        ↓
HTML / PDF / Word / slides
```

A minimal Quarto document may start:

````markdown
---
title: "Replication Notes"
format: html
---

# Analysis

```{r}
summary(df)
```
````

Quarto has its own syntax and options, so treat it as a **Markdown-based publishing system**, not plain Markdown.

---

# 56. Markdown + Pandoc

Pandoc converts between many document formats.

Example:

```bash
pandoc notes.md -o notes.pdf
```

or:

```bash
pandoc notes.md -o notes.docx
```

Academic features can include:

- math;
- citations;
- bibliography;
- footnotes;
- metadata;
- PDF conversion through LaTeX.

This is useful when you like writing in Markdown but need a shareable PDF or Word document.

# 57. When to Use Markdown vs. LaTeX

| Task | Markdown | LaTeX |
|---|---:|---:|
| quick research notes | excellent | unnecessary |
| project README | excellent | poor fit |
| replication instructions | excellent | unnecessary |
| literature notes | excellent | good but slower |
| seminar notes | excellent | slower |
| GitHub documentation | excellent | poor fit |
| simple equations | good if renderer supports math | excellent |
| complicated equations | okay | excellent |
| polished regression tables | limited | excellent |
| theorem-heavy theory paper | limited | excellent |
| journal submission | sometimes | usually excellent |
| reproducible Quarto report | excellent | backend may still use LaTeX |

A productive PhD workflow often uses **both**, not one or the other.

---

# 58. When to Use Markdown vs. Word

Markdown is better when:

- you want plain-text version control;
- you work with code;
- structure matters more than manual layout;
- you want fast notes;
- you use GitHub/Quarto/Jupyter.

Word is better when:

- collaborators require track changes;
- complex visual page layout is needed;
- nontechnical coauthors prefer WYSIWYG editing;
- the final deliverable must be `.docx`.

Pandoc/Quarto can sometimes bridge the two.

# 59. A Practical Econ PhD File Structure

```text
project_name/
|-- README.md
|-- paper/
|   |-- main.tex
|   `-- references.bib
|-- notes/
|   |-- literature/
|   |-- meetings/
|   `-- research_log/
|-- code/
|   |-- 01_clean.R
|   |-- 02_analysis.R
|   `-- 03_figures.R
|-- data/
|   |-- raw/
|   `-- clean/
|-- figures/
`-- output/
```

Markdown belongs naturally in:

```text
README.md
notes/literature/*.md
notes/meetings/*.md
notes/research_log/*.md
```

LaTeX can remain in `paper/`.

# 60. Research Meeting Note Template

````markdown
# Advisor Meeting - 2026-09-26

## Updates since last meeting

- Completed baseline sample construction.
- Replicated Table 1.
- Added county-level controls.

## Results to discuss

1. Baseline coefficient is stable.
2. Standard errors increase substantially with state-level clustering.

## Questions

- Which clustering level is preferred?
- Should 2010 be excluded because of the coding change?

## Decisions

- Keep 2010 for now.
- Add state-specific trends only as a robustness check.

## Next actions

- [ ] Run alternative clustering.
- [ ] Create event-time figure.
- [ ] Draft data section.

## Next meeting

TBD.

# 61. A Better Way to Write TODOs

Instead of scattering vague notes:

```text
fix this later
```

use searchable tags:

```markdown
**TODO:** Check sample restriction.

**VERIFY:** Confirm Table 2 observation count.

**QUESTION:** Why does the coefficient change after 2018?

**DECISION:** Use county-level clustering in the main table.
```

Then your editor can search `TODO:` or `VERIFY:` across the project.

---

# 62. Reproducibility Notes

A good Markdown replication note might include:

```markdown
## Environment

- R 4.5.x
- Stata 19
- Python 3.13

## Execution order

1. `01_download.R`
2. `02_clean.R`
3. `03_analysis.R`
4. `04_tables.R`

## Expected runtime

Approximately 12 minutes on a laptop.

## Restricted data

The confidential administrative dataset is not distributed with the repository.
```

This is much more useful to a future collaborator than undocumented code.

# 63. Writing an Analysis Plan in Markdown

````markdown
# Analysis Plan

## Research question

## Sample

### Inclusion criteria

### Exclusion criteria

## Outcomes

### Primary outcome

### Secondary outcomes

## Main specification

$$
y_i = x_i'\beta + \varepsilon_i.
$$

## Standard errors

## Heterogeneity

## Robustness checks

- [ ] Alternative sample
- [ ] Alternative outcome construction
- [ ] Alternative clustering

## Tables and figures planned

1. Summary statistics
2. Main result
3. Heterogeneity
4. Robustness appendix
````

This is a good example of Markdown handling **structure and planning** while math is delegated to LaTeX-style math syntax.

# 68. What Beginners Should Learn First

You do **not** need to memorize the whole guide.

For your first week, learn these ten things:

1. `#`, `##`, `###` headings;
2. blank lines for paragraphs;
3. `**bold**` and `*italic*`;
4. `` `inline code` ``;
5. triple-backtick code blocks;
6. `-` bullet lists;
7. `[text](url)` links;
8. `![alt](path)` images;
9. simple pipe tables;
10. `$...$` math **if your renderer supports it**.

Everything else can be looked up when needed.

# 69. Recommended Beginner Workflow for an Econ PhD Student

A practical progression:

**Week 1:** Use Markdown for seminar notes and paper-reading notes.

**Week 2:** Create a `README.md` for one research project.

**Week 3:** Start a dated research log.

**Week 4:** Put the project under Git and use Markdown for documentation.

**Later:** Learn Quarto/Pandoc if you want citations, executable code, cross-references, and PDF/HTML output from Markdown.

The goal is not to become a Markdown expert. The goal is to make your research **easier to understand, reproduce, and resume**.

# 73. Final Advice

Markdown is intentionally small. Its power comes from combining a few simple conventions with good research habits.

For an Econ PhD student, the highest-value uses are usually not elaborate formatting. They are:

- keeping notes readable;
- recording what you did;
- documenting code and data;
- making research folders understandable;
- preserving decisions and unresolved questions;
- creating reproducible project instructions;
- writing source text that remains readable even without rendering.

If a Markdown file becomes difficult to read as plain text, you may be fighting the format. At that point, consider whether LaTeX, Quarto, a spreadsheet, or Word is the better tool.
